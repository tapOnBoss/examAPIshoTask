    Find API routes that correspond to the functionality needed for the image.

  1.  Create an "app.js" 
    file that contains a registration endpoint for users.
    
     The endpoint should accept data for the
      user's ID, 
     name, 
     last name, 
     email, 
     password, and time of registration.

  +  Create a MongoDB database and connect to it from the application.

+ Implement CRUD methods for the user data and add extra authentication using tokens.

 =   In the MongoDB database, 
  =  create a collection for storing task data,
    
     including a user ID, 
     task ID, 
     description, 
     timestamps, 
     and status.

   2. Create two lists in the application,
    
   +  one for tasks that have been completed and one
    +  for tasks that are still to be done,
    
   +  and link them to the appropriate user IDs.

=    Implement token-based authentication 
 =   to ensure that only authorized users can access the task data.

  3.  Use the task data to create a table
    + in the application that displays the task information,
    
     including the 
     user ID, 
     task ID, 
     description, 
     timestamps, 
     and status.

--------------------
   4. Finally you can use the models to perform CRUD operations on the task data, 
    +and use the user id to filter the tasks by user.

   + You can also create two lists to store completed and pending tasks, 
   + and use the user id to link them to the appropriate user.

    You can use the task data to create a table in the application that displays the task information, 
    including the user id, 
    task id, 
    description, 
    timestamps, 
    and status.
-----------------------
   5. You will also need to handle user authentication when a user attempts to login. 
   + You can use the email and password provided by the user to look up their account in the database, 
   + and then use jsonwebtoken to generate a token that can be used for authentication on protected routes.

   + To improve the security of your application, 
   + you should hash the user's password 
   + before storing it in the database 
  6.  and use a package like bcrypt to compare the hashed password 
   == when the user attempts to login.

  =  You can also include additional security measures like rate limiting, CORS headers, 
   = and input validation to protect your application from common attacks.

   + Finally, you should also include proper error handling throughout your application, 
   + so that users are provided with clear and informative error messages when something goes wrong.

   + To test your application, 
   + you can use a library like Mocha or Jest and test the routes, 
    models, 
    and helper functions.

   7. Once your application is complete and tested,
    + you can deploy it to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS, 
    so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere.
---------------------
    Another important aspect you should consider is to add a logging system to your application, 
    so you can track the activity and detect errors or potential issues. 
    You can use a package like Winston to log messages, 
    and configure it to write to different transports like a file or a remote service like Loggly or Papertrail.

    Another important thing to consider is to create a separate environment variable file 
    and store the sensitive data like secret keys, 
    database urls and any other information that should not be exposed in the codebase.

    It's also important to keep your dependencies up-to-date, 
    as new versions of packages can bring security fixes and other improvements. 
    You can use a package 
    like Greenkeeper or 
    dependabot to automatically update your dependencies and keep your application secure.

    For the front-end, 
    you can use a framework like React or Angular to create the UI and interact with the API. 
    You will need to create endpoints
     in the API to handle the requests and responses between the front-end and the back-end.

    Finally, 
    it's important to keep your application well-documented, 
    so that other developers can understand how it works and make contributions. 
    You can use comments, JSDoc, or a tool like Doxdox to generate API documentation from your code.
---------------------
    Another important aspect to consider is to implement a caching mechanism in your application. 
    Caching can help to improve the performance of your application 
    by storing the frequently requested data in a faster 
    storage layer, 
    like memory, 
    and reducing the number of requests to the database or other external services. 
    You can use a package like Redis or Memcached to implement caching in your application.

    Additionally, you can implement pagination in your application to handle large datasets 
    and reduce the amount of data that is sent to the client at once. 
    This can improve the performance of your application, 
    especially when handling large collections of data like tasks.

    Another important aspect is security, 
    you can use helmet package to set some HTTP headers to help protect your app 
    from some well-known web vulnerabilities.

    As for the task collection, 
    you can implement a feature of task prioritization, 
    where you can sort the tasks by priority, 
    and display the most important tasks first.

    It's also important to implement a feature of task search, 
    where users can search for tasks by keywords, 
    description, and date range.

    Lastly, you can also implement a feature of task notifications, 
    where users can receive notifications about tasks that are due soon, 
    or when a task has been completed.
--------------------
Another important aspect to consider is scalability, 
as your application grows, the number of requests and data it handles can increase significantly. 
To handle this, 
you can use a load balancer 
like HAProxy or 
Nginx to distribute the incoming requests across multiple servers 
and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of your application.

Additionally, 
you can use a microservices architecture to break down your application into smaller,
 more manageable services. 
This can help to improve the scalability, 
reliability, 
and maintainability of your application.

Another important aspect is monitoring, 
you can use a monitoring tool like Prometheus or New Relic to track the performance of your application, 
and detect and diagnose issues.

You can also consider implementing a feature of task collaboration, 
where multiple users can work on a task together, 
and share comments and updates.

Finally, 
you can also consider implementing a feature of task recurring, 
where a task can be set to repeat on a regular basis, 
such as daily, 
weekly, 
or monthly
-----------------
    Another important aspect to consider is performance optimization, 
    as your application grows, 
    the number of requests and data it handles can increase significantly. 
    To handle this, you can use a package like gzip to compress the data that is sent to the client, 
    this will help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and improve the overall performance of your application.

    Additionally, 
    you can use a package like compression to compress the data that is sent to the client, 
    this will help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred a
    nd improve the overall performance of your application.

    Another important aspect is security, 
    you can use a package like helmet to set some HTTP headers 
    to help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities.

    Another important aspect to consider is data backup, 
    you can use a package like mongodump to create backups of your MongoDB database, 
    and schedule regular backups to ensure that your data is safe and can be easily restored in case of a disaster.

    You can also consider implementing a feature of task history, 
    where users can view a history of the tasks they have completed and the tasks they are currently working on.

    Finally, 
    you can also consider implementing a feature of task export, 
    where users can export their tasks in different file formats, 
    such as CSV, Excel, and PDF.
-----------------
    Another important aspect to consider is internationalization (i18n), 
    this means that your application should be able to support multiple languages, 
    
    so that users can interact with your application in their preferred language. 
    You can use a package like i18next to handle the translations and localization of your application.

    Additionally, 
    you can use a package like moment.js
     to handle the date and time formatting, 
    this will help to ensure that the date and time are displayed correctly for users in different regions and time zones.

    Another important aspect is error tracking, 
    you can use a package like Sentry to track the errors and exceptions in your application, 
    and receive notifications when an error occurs. 
    
    
    This will help you to identify and fix issues quickly.

    Another important aspect to consider is accessibility, 
    your application should be accessible to users with disabilities, 
    you can use a package like a11y to check your application for accessibility issues, 
    
    
    and make sure that it's easy to use for everyone.

    You can also consider implementing a feature of task categorization, 
    where users can categorize their tasks by different types, 
    such as work, 
    personal, and shopping.

    Finally, 
    you can also consider implementing a feature of task attachments, 
    where users can attach files, 
    images, 
    and documents to their tasks.
