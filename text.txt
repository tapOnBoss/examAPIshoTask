functionality list:

API routes that correspond to the functionality needed for the image.

Data for the user's ID, name, last name, email, password, and time of registration.

MongoDB database is connected to it from the application.

CRUD methods for the user data and add extra authentication using tokens.

In the MongoDB database, 
create a collection for storing task data, 
including:  
User ID, 
Task ID, 
Description, 
Timestamps, 
Status.
(all list items are noncaps in code)

Create two lists in the application, 
one for tasks that have been completed and one for tasks that are still to be done, 
and link them to the appropriate user IDs.

Have token-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the task data.

Use the task data to create a table in the application that displays the task information, 
including:
user ID, 
task ID, 
description, 
timestamps,
status.

Handle user authentication when a user attempts to login.
Uses the email and password provided by the user 
to look up their account in the database, 
and then use jsonwebtoken to generate a token 
that can be used for authentication on protected routes.

Improved the security, 
Hash the user's password before storing it in the database,
Using a package bcrypt to compare the hashed password when the user attempts to login.
Included additional security measures like rate limiting, CORS headers, 
and input validation to protect your application from common attacks.

Have error handling throughout your application, 
so that users are provided with clear and informative error messages when something goes wrong.

Can test application, 
Using a library like Mocha or Jest,
test the routes, 
models, 
helper
(functions).

There is Separate environment variable file
Storing the sensitive data like secret keys, 
database urls and any other information that should not be exposed in the codebase.

Caching mechanism in your application. 
Caching can help to improve the performance of your application 
by storing the frequently requested data in a faster storage layer, 
like memory, 
and reducing the number of requests to the database or other external services.
Redis (Memcached) to implement caching in your application.

Pagination in application handles large datasets,
Reduces the amount of data that is sent to the client at once. 
This can improve the performance of your application, 
especially when handling large collections of data like tasks.

Helmet package to set some HTTP headers 
Protect app from some well-known web vulnerabilities.

Feature of task search, where users can search for tasks by keywords, description, and date range.

Feature of task notifications, 
Where users can receive notifications about tasks that are due soon, 
Or when a task has been completed.

pplication grows, the number of requests and data it handles can increase significantly. 
To handle this, Using a load balancer:
HAProxy
(or Nginx)
To distribute the incoming requests across multiple servers and improve the overall performance,
Responsiveness.

Using a microservices architecture to break down your application into smaller, 
more manageable services. 
This can help to improve the scalability,
reliability, 
and maintainability of your application.

Using a monitoring tool like Prometheus 
or New Relic to track the performance of your application,
detect and diagnose issues.

Feature of task collaboration, 
where multiple users can work on a task together, and share comments and updates.

feature of task recurring, 
where a task can be set to repeat on a regular basis, 
such as daily, 
weekly, or monthly.

Consider is performance optimization, 
as application grows, 
the number of requests and data it handles can increase significantly. 
To handle this, 
you can use a package like gzip to compress the data that is sent to the client, 
this will help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and improve the overall performance

Using a package compression to compress the data that is sent to the client, 
this will help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and improve the overall performance of your application.

Considered data backup, 
you can use a package like mongodump to create backups of your MongoDB database, 
and schedule regular backups to ensure that your data is safe and can be easily restored in case of a disaster.
You can also consider implementing a feature of task history.

Considered implementing a feature of task history, where users can view a history 
of the tasks they have completed and the tasks they are currently working on.

Consider implementing a feature of task export, where users can export their tasks in different file formats, s
uch as CSV, 
Excel,
PDF.

Considered is internationalization (i18n), 
this means that your application should be able to support multiple languages, 
so that users can interact with your application in their preferred language. 
You can use a package like i18next to handle the translations and localization of your application.

Handle the date and time formatting, 
this will help to ensure that the date and time are displayed correctly for users in different regions 
and time zones.

error tracking,
Using a package like Sentry to track the errors and exceptions in your application, 
and receive notifications when an error occurs. 
This will help you to identify and fix issues quickly.

Application should be accessible to users with disabilities, 
Using a package a11y to check your application for accessibility issues, 
and make sure that it's easy to use for everyone.

Consider implementing a feature of task categorization, 
where users can categorize their tasks by different types, 
such as work, personal, and shopping.

Considered implementing a feature of task attachments, 
where users can attach:
files,
images, 
documents 
(to their tasks).

---------------features on update LISTED below------------------------------------

Configure environment variables on the server to keep sensitive information 
like secret keys and database credentials secure.

    Internationalization (i18n) support: You can add support for multiple languages in your application by using a library like i18n.

    Unit testing: You can write unit tests for your code using a library like Jest or Mocha. Unit testing helps you catch bugs and ensure that your code is working as expected.

    Documenting: You can use a library like JSDoc or Swagger to automatically generate documentation for your code, making it easy for others to understand and use.

    Accessibility: You can add accessibility features to your application to make it usable for users with disabilities.

    Performance: You can improve the performance of your application by optimizing the code and using techniques like caching and code splitting.

    Monitoring: You can add monitoring tools to your application to track performance and errors, like Prometheus and Grafana, New Relic, or Datadog.

    Deployment: You can use a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the front-end, 
Can use a framework like React or Angular to create the UI and interact with the API. 
Will need to create endpoints in the API
To handle the requests and responses between the front-end and the back-end.

Can track the activity and detect errors or potential issues. 
You can use a package like Winston to log messages, 
and configure it to write to different transports like a file or a remote service:
Loggly,
Papertrail.

Once your application is complete and tested, 
you can deploy it to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS, 
so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere.
