/register route, where you're not able to register a user properly.

To start, you will need to add a debugger statement in the relevant part of your code,
in this case,
it would be inside the callback function of the user.save method.

can do this:

 router.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  const user = new User(req.body);
  user.save((err, user) => {
    debugger;
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error registering user' });
    }
    const token = authHelper.generateToken(user);
    return res.status(200).json({ message: 'User registered successfully', token });
  });
});


Next, you will need to start your application in debugging mode, 
you can do this by running the command node inspect app.js

Once your application is running in debugging mode, 
you can use the command c to continue execution until the next breakpoint 
(in this case, the debugger statement in your code).

You can then use the command repl to access the current context of your application, 
where you can inspect variables and see the values. For example, 
you can use console.log(err) to see the error message, 
or console.log(req.body) to see the request body.

You can also use the command n to step over the next line of code, 
and the command s to step into the next function call.

Once you have identified the issue, 
you can make the necessary changes to your code and test it again.
